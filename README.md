# FVP Course

---
## Course Overview 
[Arm Virtual Hardware](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Virtual%20Hardware) (AVH) delivers ready-to-use models of Arm-based processors, systems and third party hardware. Arm Virtual Hardware runs as an application in the cloud to simplify, automate, accelerate and cost-reduce maintenance and development processes. This enables fast prototyping, build and deployment with efficient selection of the best Arm-based silicon for a new or updated application.

* **Arm Virtual Hardware (AVH)** supports the software development cycle of embedded, IoT, and ML applications and provides essential components for effective integration into Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and MLOps development flows.
* **Fixed Virtual Platforms (FVPs)**
Precise simulation models of Arm Cortex-M based reference platforms, such as Corstone-300/310.
* **AVH Corellium models**
Functionally accurate virtual representations of popular IoT development boards
Cortex-A based systems with Linux OS support, such as Raspberry Pi and NXP i.MX.
